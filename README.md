# The RAnD Method (Randomization of Affine Models)
The RAnD Method for randomizing of Affine Diffusion processes. The **Python** and **MATLAB** codes to generate randomized Characteristic Functions are provided.
The codes are based on the article<br /> **"On Randomization of Affine Diffusion Processes with Application to Pricing of Options on VIX and S&P 500".**<br /> by Lech A. Grzelak, L.A.Grzelak@uu.nl

You are free to use the codes for non-commercial purposes.
