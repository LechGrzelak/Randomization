# Randomization
The RAnD Method for randomizing of Affine Diffusion processes. The Python and MATLAB codes to generate randomized Characteristic Functions are provided.
The codes are based on the article **"On Randomization of Affine Diffusion Processes with Application to Pricing of Options on {VIX} and {S&P} 500".** by Lech A. Grzelak, L.A.Grzelak@uu.nl

You are free to use the codes for non-commercial purposes.
